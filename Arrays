Remember arrays 1st is 0, 2nd is 1st, so on. Range is 0 - n-1. numbers are called indexes


example of putting inputs into arrays
DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton");
DVD lionKingDVD = new DVD("The Lion King", 2019, "Jon Favreau");

// Put "The Incredibles" into the 4th place: index 3.
dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;

// Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;

// Put "The Lion King" into the 3rd place: index 2.
dvdCollection[2] = lionKingDVD;


Reading Items from Arrays (note:10 is null bc java sets arrays not entered to null):
// Print out what's in indexes 7, 10, and 3.
System.out.println(dvdCollection[7]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[10]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[3]);

// Will print:

// The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, released in 2012
// null
// Star Wars, directed by George Lucas, released in 1977


This is putting in 10 numbers into array (indexes from 0 to 9):
int[] squareNumbers = new int[10];

// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // We need to be careful with the 0-indexing. The next square number
    // is given by (i + 1) * (i + 1).
    // Calculate it and insert it into the Array at index i.
    int square = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
    squareNumbers[i] = square;
}

Remember if you have an array[6] you cannot put something into array[6] because n-1 so only array[0]-array[5].

To check the capacity of an array do (array is the name of array)(how many it can have):
int capacity = array.length;
System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + capacity);

To check the length of an array do (how many it does have): 
// Create a new array with a capacity of 6.
int[] array = new int[6];

// Current length is 0, because it has 0 elements.
int length = 0;

// Add 3 items into it.
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    array[i] = i * i;
    // Each time we add an element, the length goes up by one.
    length++;
}

System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + array.length); --6
System.out.println("The Array has a length of " + length); --3
